	<h1>As Remittances Increase, Central American Economies Suffer</h1>

	</div>

	<h4>NINAR TAHA</h4>
	<h5>November 24, 2025</h5>

	<p>Remittances to Central America have significantly increased since the pandemic due to limited employment opportunities. For Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, this pattern has only contributed to a growing reliance on remittances for each country’s overall economy.

All three countries display rising inflows over time, with a noticeable acceleration after 2020. Guatemala’s red line starts near zero in 2000 and climbs steeply to $21.65 billion by 2024, far above the others. Honduras’s orange line increases from around $2 billion in 2000 to $9.53 billion in 2024, while El Salvador’s brown line rises from roughly $2 billion to $8.49 billion over the same period. The chart notes that values are based on 2024 data in current US dollars. The data source is the World Bank." /></noscript></div>

		<p>Immanuel Ness, a political economist at Brooklyn College, says that the increase to the percentage of remittances of each country’s GDP is not a positive thing. “It shows that the economy is unable to develop on its own, and it’s dependent on other countries for its development,” says Ness. </p>

Honduras starts at about 15% in 2000 and rises to 26% by 2023. El Salvador rises from approximately 7% in 2000 to 24% in 2023. Guatemala increases from roughly 3% in 2000 to 19% in 2023. The chart visualizes a marked upward trend for all three countries, with remittances making up a larger share of GDP over time. Honduras has the highest percentage throughout most years, followed by El Salvador and then Guatemala. The data source is the World Bank." /></noscript></div>

		<p>He says that countries do not tend to develop as a consequence of migration, and there is no evidence to show that they are building up industries, technologies or agriculture. He says it’s still too soon to understand the impact of the current immigration crackdown on remittances, but Ness expects that people will still migrate wherever there are job opportunities, regardless of the administration. </p>
